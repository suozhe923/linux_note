- `git help <command>`: get help for a git command
- `git init`: creates a new git repo, with data stored in the `.git` directory
- `git status`: tells you what's going on
- `git add <filename>`: adds files to staging area
- `git commit`: creates a new commit
    - Write [good commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)!
    - Even more reasons to write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)!
- `git log`: shows a flattened log of history
- `git log --all --graph --decorate`: visualizes history as a DAG
- `git diff <filename>`: show changes you made relative to the staging area
- `git diff <revision> <filename>`: shows differences in a file between snapshots
- `git checkout <revision>`: updates HEAD and current branch

## Branching and merging

{% comment %}

Branching allows you to "fork" version history. It can be helpful for working
on independent features or bug fixes in parallel. The `git branch` command can
be used to create new branches; `git checkout -b <branch name>` creates and
branch and checks it out.

Merging is the opposite of branching: it allows you to combine forked version
histories, e.g. merging a feature branch back into master. The `git merge`
command is used for merging.

{% endcomment %}

- `git branch`: shows branches
- `git branch <name>`: creates a branch
- `git checkout -b <name>`: creates a branch and switches to it
    - same as `git branch <name>; git checkout <name>`
- `git merge <revision>`: merges into current branch
- `git mergetool`: use a fancy tool to help resolve merge conflicts
- `git rebase`: rebase set of patches onto a new base

## Remotes

- `git remote`: list remotes
- `git remote add <name> <url>`: add a remote
- `git push <remote> <local branch>:<remote branch>`: send objects to remote, and update remote reference
- `git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<remote branch>`: set up correspondence between local and remote branch
- `git fetch`: retrieve objects/references from a remote
- `git pull`: same as `git fetch; git merge`
- `git clone`: download repository from remote

## Undo

- `git commit --amend`: edit a commit's contents/message
- `git reset HEAD <file>`: unstage a file
- `git checkout -- <file>`: discard changes

# Advanced Git

- `git config`: Git is [highly customizable](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config)
- `git clone --depth=1`: shallow clone, without entire version history
- `git add -p`: interactive staging
- `git rebase -i`: interactive rebasing
- `git blame`: show who last edited which line
- `git stash`: temporarily remove modifications to working directory
- `git bisect`: binary search history (e.g. for regressions)
- `.gitignore`: [specify](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) intentionally untracked files to ignore

# Miscellaneous

- **GUIs**: there are many [GUI clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
out there for Git. We personally don't use them and use the command-line
interface instead.
- **Shell integration**: it's super handy to have a Git status as part of your
shell prompt ([zsh](https://github.com/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt),
[bash](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt)). Often included in
frameworks like [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).
- **Editor integration**: similarly to the above, handy integrations with many
features. [fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) is the standard
one for Vim.
- **Workflows**: we taught you the data model, plus some basic commands; we
didn't tell you what practices to follow when working on big projects (and
there are [many](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
[different](https://www.endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful)
[approaches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)).
- **GitHub**: Git is not GitHub. GitHub has a specific way of contributing code
to other projects, called [pull
requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
- **Other Git providers**: GitHub is not special: there are many Git repository
hosts, like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

# Resources

- [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is **highly recommended reading**.
Going through Chapters 1--5 should teach you most of what you need to use Git
proficiently, now that you understand the data model. The later chapters have
some interesting, advanced material.
- [Oh Shit, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/) is a short guide on how to recover
from some common Git mistakes.
- [Git for Computer
Scientists](https://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/) is a
short explanation of Git's data model, with less pseudocode and more fancy
diagrams than these lecture notes.
- [Git from the Bottom Up](https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/)
is a detailed explanation of Git's implementation details beyond just the data
model, for the curious.
- [How to explain git in simple
words](https://smusamashah.github.io/blog/2017/10/14/explain-git-in-simple-words)
- [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) is a browser-based
game that teaches you Git.

# Exercises

1. If you don't have any past experience with Git, either try reading the first
   couple chapters of [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) or go through a
   tutorial like [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/). As
   you're working through it, relate Git commands to the data model.
1. Clone the [repository for the
class website](https://github.com/missing-semester/missing-semester).
    1. Explore the version history by visualizing it as a graph.
    1. Who was the last person to modify `README.md`? (Hint: use `git log` with
       an argument).
    1. What was the commit message associated with the last modification to the
       `collections:` line of `_config.yml`? (Hint: use `git blame` and `git
       show`).
1. One common mistake when learning Git is to commit large files that should
   not be managed by Git or adding sensitive information. Try adding a file to
   a repository, making some commits and then deleting that file from history
   (you may want to look at
   [this](https://help.github.com/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository/)).
1. Clone some repository from GitHub, and modify one of its existing files.
   What happens when you do `git stash`? What do you see when running `git log
   --all --oneline`? Run `git stash pop` to undo what you did with `git stash`.
   In what scenario might this be useful?
1. Like many command line tools, Git provides a configuration file (or dotfile)
   called `~/.gitconfig`. Create an alias in `~/.gitconfig` so that when you
   run `git graph`, you get the output of `git log --all --graph --decorate
   --oneline`. You can do this by directly
   [editing](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-alias)
   the `~/.gitconfig` file, or you can use the `git config` command to add the
   alias. Information about git aliases can be found
   [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases).
1. You can define global ignore patterns in `~/.gitignore_global` after running
   `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global`. Do this, and
   set up your global gitignore file to ignore OS-specific or editor-specific
   temporary files, like `.DS_Store`.
1. Fork the [repository for the class
   website](https://github.com/missing-semester/missing-semester), find a typo
   or some other improvement you can make, and submit a pull request on GitHub
   (you may want to look at [this](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)).
   Please only submit PRs that are useful (don't spam us, please!). If you
   can't find an improvement to make, you can skip this exercise.
